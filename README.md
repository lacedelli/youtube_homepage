## Thoughts before heading in
Shouldn't be too hard, time consuming if anything really, the project will be mostly remembering all the syntactic details about HTML and CSS, maybe spend some time learning how to properly use columns or floating in order to layout the page properly, which admittedly, gives me a bunch of problems in the past for other projects.
