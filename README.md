## Thoughts before heading in
Shouldn't be too hard, time consuming if anything really, the project will be mostly remembering all the syntactic details about HTML and CSS, maybe spend some time learning how to properly use columns or floating in order to layout the page properly, which admittedly, gives me a bunch of problems in the past for other projects.

## Thoughts after finishing
I 100% underestimated the amount of trouble that building this project would be; for once, I didn't prepare well enough at the beginning, making every little aspect of the page that I didn't plan out when thinking about a layout take an immense amount of time to actually lay out in the final project.

The second thing that amazed me is how, after all this time I just now started harnessing the power of flexbox and the CSS grid combined, which are both tools that I need to master in order to be quicker and more effective in my future layout projects.

In short, plan more, learn better CSS grid skills.
The page isn't as good as it *could* be, but in all honesty, I kinda want to call it quits for now and move on to the next thing.
